# Simple-8
A new fantasy console, made with Python and pygame.

# Specs:
I made this hardware inferior to the Atari 2600, because i like how homebrew developers go through all these limitations. Anyways:<br>
- 24x24 pixel screen<br>
- 7 color palette, can use RGB too<br>
- Uses python for programming<br>
- And i don't remember all the specs it has, but i think this is all the specs it has, so... :P<br>

# Documentation
~~This project dosen't have documentation yet, but i think i'm gonna make the documentation tommorow, so... yeah. Read the code if you want to see how the project works. :P~~
<br>Edit: I forgot to put it in here, but now ***there is*** documentation!<br>It is recommended that you read the whole documentation.
